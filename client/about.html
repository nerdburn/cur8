      <h3>What does Cur8 do?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Save a list of all the sites you want to save</li>
        <li>Allow you to search that list for a specific result</li>
        <li>Saves you time, energy and sweaty palms</li>
      </ol>
      <p>My husband and I have Google races. We race who can find the fastest, best answer or resource we are searching for. We are in the Information Age, where finding specific information is a vital part of our daily lives. I created Cur8 to save me painful time of curating through sites that aren’t applicable or that I deem reputable (and not just to win at our Google races). Google has done an amazing job building a search engine, I’m simply trying to add that human touch through Cur8 - where we are narrowing down even more.</p>
      <h3>How does it Work?</h3>
