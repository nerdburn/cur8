      <h3>What does Cur8 do?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Save a list of all the sites you want to save</li>
        <li>Allow you to search that list for a specific result</li>
        <li>Saves you time, energy and sweaty palms</li>
      </ol>
      <p>My husband and I have Google races. We race to see who can find the fastest, best answer or resource we're searching for. We're in the Information Age, where finding specific information is a vital part of our daily lives. I created Cur8 to save me the painful time of curating through search results that aren't applicable. Google has done an amazing job of building a search engine, I'm simply trying to add that human touch, to slim the results to only those sites I love and trust.</p>
      <h3>How does it Work?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Download the app extension here and create an account.</li>
        <li>Go to any site you would like to save.</li>
        <li>Select the app extension icon on your browser and select 'save site'.</li>
        <li>Select the app extension and enter a search to get results from your saved sites.</li>
        <li>To view or delete your saved sites, go to Cur8.io</li>
      </ol>
